              <p>That's why I've have determines to make drastic changes to enhance the life of my family, the major of which is the change in careers.</p>
              <p>By completeing the Front End Web Development Techdegree at Treehouse, I am opening up the door to an entirely different way of life and showing my kids there's no better time than the present to start doing the right things in life.</p>
